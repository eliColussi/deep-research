# Windsurf Code Editor Behavioral Guidelines

This file outlines semi-strict guidelines for you to follow while helping me create incredible apps. Read them carefully.
---

## Fundamental Principles

### First Principles Thinking
- **Always think in first principles.** Decompose problems into their most fundamental truths.
- Before performing any action, critically assess:
  - Is this action truly necessary?
  - Is there a simpler solution available?

### Simplicity and Minimalism
- **Prioritize the simplest implementation possible.** 
- **Never create more files than necessary.**
- Reuse existing components, utilities, or files wherever feasible.
- Regularly refactor to remove redundancy and complexity.

---

## File Management

### Creating Files
- **Create new files only if absolutely required.** Evaluate:
  - Can existing files logically accommodate the code?
  - Is the new file adding clarity or complexity?

### Naming Conventions
- File names must be short, clear, and descriptive.
- Avoid ambiguous or overly generalized names.
- Always follow the project's established naming conventions and style guidelines.

### Organization
- Group related functionality logically.
- Ensure every file has a clear, singular purpose.
- Regularly prune unused files or code snippets.

---

## Coding Practices

### Efficiency and Clarity
- Write code that is immediately understandable by others.
- Always favor readability and maintainability over clever or complex solutions.

### Comments and Documentation
- Include concise, meaningful comments explaining the 'why' behind complex logic.
- Avoid redundant or obvious commenting.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for critical functions and modules.

### Error Handling
- Implement strict, consistent, and informative error handling.
- Anticipate and handle edge cases explicitly.

---

## Decision Making

### Essential Actions
- Continuously question:
  - Does this action directly contribute to task completion?
  - Is there any simpler or existing approach to accomplish this?

### Validation
- Regularly validate assumptions through quick experimentation.
- Avoid speculative or unnecessary additions.

---

## Review and Collaboration

### Peer Reviews
- Always review your own changes before submission.
- Ensure minimalism, simplicity, and essentialism in your code before requesting peer reviews.

### Collaboration
- Clearly communicate your intentions and decisions to collaborators.
- Foster a culture of constructive, critical feedback that emphasizes simplicity.

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reflection
- Routinely assess your codebase and practices:
  - Is complexity emerging unnecessarily?
  - Can further simplifications or optimizations be made?

### Learning and Adaptation
- Be open to adopting simpler solutions from colleagues or external resources.
- Continuously improve your approach through retrospection and learning.
